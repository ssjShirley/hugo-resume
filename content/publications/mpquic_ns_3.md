**S. Shu**, W. Yang, J. Pan and L. Cai, \"A Multipath Extension to the QUIC Module for ns-3,\" 2023 Workshop on ns-3 (WNS3), Arlington, VA, USA, 2023, pp. 608-615, doi: 3592149.3592803

Abstract: Network transmission with multiple interfaces is desirable for the next-generation Internet to improve end-to-end performance and reliability. Multipath QUIC is thus proposed to utilize multiple interfaces for Internet transmission with QUIC, while QUIC is already standardized and active in use by several mainstream web browsers. However, the majority of the (MP)QUIC experimental platforms are built upon real systems or network emulators, which makes it challenging to investigate and experiment for further exploration. An MPQUIC simulation platform is still largely missing in the research community. In this paper, we present our implementation and improvement of MPQUIC based on the QUIC module for ns-3, along with a description of the features that we have implemented. We also demonstrate the performance of MPQUIC using an expanding series of experiments under various scenarios. Our implementation meets the demands for scalable multiple paths, flexible path schedulers, and compatible congestion control algorithms.
