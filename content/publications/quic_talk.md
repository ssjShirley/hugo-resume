QUIC, which stands for Quick UDP Internet Connections, is a transport layer protocol developed by Google. It was designed to improve the performance of web communication and address some of the limitations of the traditional Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). QUIC operates over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) instead of TCP, which allows for faster and more efficient data transmission.

QUIC was initially developed to enhance the performance of web applications, particularly for mobile devices and real-time communication. It aims to reduce latency and improve reliability, even in challenging network conditions. By using UDP as its underlying protocol, QUIC avoids some of the overhead and congestion control mechanisms of TCP, resulting in faster connection establishment and reduced latency.

One of the key features of QUIC is its ability to establish secure connections more quickly. It incorporates encryption from the beginning, providing transport security by default. This eliminates the need for additional layers such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) in the initial handshake process, reducing the latency associated with establishing secure connections.

This talk will introduce it in following topics. 
- What is QUIC? 
- Why does QUIC become popular? 
- What is the benefits of QUIC? 
- some related works around QUIC.
